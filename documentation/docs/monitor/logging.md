# Logging

Jitar logs all activity, errors and more. To control the amount of logging, you can set the level of interest. The log level is provided as a server option by using the flag `--loglevel` during startup.

```bash
node --experimental-network-imports dist/standalone.js --loglevel=debug --config=services/standalone.json
```

This flag is optional. When not set, the default log level info is used. Other options are debug, warn or error. All levels will be explained next.

Warning: Itâ€™s not possible to provide an output location, so all the messages are printed pretty in the console. Rerouting the log to a file from the console results in a hard to read log file.

## Debug

The debug level is the most verbose level. It will output all debug, info, warn and error messages. The debug level contains messages of running background processes. These are:

* Health requested
* Health status requested

It's advisable to not use the debug level in production because the health of a worker gets requested frequently. If you experience any issues with this, you can use this mode.

## Info

The info level will output all info, warn and error messages. The info level contains messages for all normal actions. These are:

* Startup message
* Assets retrieved
* Client registration
* Module retrieval
* Worker registration / retrieval
* Registered procedure names
* Forward message
* RPC registration / execution

You can use this level in production, but it is still quite verbose. If you don't need this information then the next level might be a better choice.

## Warn

The warn level will output all warn and error messages. The warn level contains messages for all unexpected results that are not errors. These are:

* Asset that could not be found

We advise to use this or the info level in production.

## Error

The error level is the most severe level. This level contains messages of all runtime errors. These are:

* Asset that could not be loaded
* Module that could not get loaded
* Worker that could not get added
* Procedure that threw an error
