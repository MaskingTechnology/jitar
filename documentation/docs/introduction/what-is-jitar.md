# What is Jitar?

## Build highly scalable full-stack applications
Building scalable applications is hard. It requires breaking an application into independently deployable pieces, like microservices. The boundaries of these pieces are sensitive to change and aren't always clear. Developing end-points and requests to arrange the communication between them brings a lot of overhead.

Jitar is designed to solve these problems. It makes the boundaries configurable so you can change them painlessly at any time and eliminates the overhead by automating the end-to-end communication.

## A runtime, not a framework
Jitar operates at runtime level. In contrast to any framework-like solution, there is no trace of Jitar in the application code. Jitar breaks up your application as configured on the go, so you can build your application as a monolith and deploy it as microservices.

## When to use
Jitar is a great tool for building applications that are expected to grow and change over time. It can be used for building small to large API driven (web) applications, like:

* Full-stack applications
* Microservices

For existing applications, Jitar can be of great assistance for load balancing (parts) of the application, or adding multi-version support.
