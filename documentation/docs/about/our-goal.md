# Our goal

Do you know where you will end at the start of a new application? We neither.

Change is the only constant, and it haunts the software industry for decades. We think that applications should be able to change without making extensive modifications and regression testing. That is our goal.

In the ideal world, a simple monolithic application can grow and transition to microservices without any refactoring. Defining what runs where should be a matter of configuration, and be changed any time.

And this is exactly what Jitar brings to the table.
