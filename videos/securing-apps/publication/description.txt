In this tutorial, we’ll guide you step-by-step through securing a full-stack React application running on Jitar.

From the available options to a fully secured setup, you’ll learn how to:

* Set up trust zones between workers and gateways
* Protect procedures from external requests
* Implement client and server middleware
* Leverage middleware for authentication

By the end of this video, you’ll have a secured full-stack app running on Jitar and a clear understanding of Jitar’s security capabilities.

The application secured in this video was originally created in Scale a Full-Stack App With Jitar. Real-world examples of OAuth-based authentication middleware can be found here:

* Server: https://github.com/MaskingTechnology/comify/blob/main/src/integrations/runtime/authenticationMiddleware.ts
