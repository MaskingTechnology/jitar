In this tutorial, we’ll guide you step-by-step through scaling a full-stack React application using Jitar. 

From adding components to running a fully distributed setup, you’ll learn how to:

* Add a new component
* Create a separate segment for independent deployment
* Build and test your app in the browser
* Understand Jitar’s runtime services: gateway, repository, proxy, and workers
* Configure and run a distributed architecture
* Inspect service logs to ensure everything works as expected

By the end of this video, you’ll have a fully functional full-stack app powered by Jitar, with a clear understanding of how Jitar’s runtime services work and how full-stack app distribution is managed through configuration.

The application that will be scaled is created using Jitar's init command shown in the "Create a Scalable Full-Stack App With Jitar" video.
