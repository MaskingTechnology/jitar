In this tutorial, we’ll guide you step-by-step through setting up a scalable full-stack application using Jitar, the distributed runtime that simplifies modern app development.

From installation to deployment, you’ll learn how to:

* Install Jitar using NPM, Yarn, or PNPM
* Create a new app with React, Vue, or backend-only templates
* Explore the project structure and understand the source, domain, and UI folders
* See a live demo of your app running in the browser
* Configure Jitar’s segmentation system and runtime services

By the end of this video, you’ll have a fully functional full-stack app powered by Jitar and a solid understanding of how the runtime distributes requests and connects frontend and backend seamlessly.
