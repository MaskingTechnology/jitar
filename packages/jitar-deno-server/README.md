# Deno server implementation for jitar!

This is an experimental implementation of a [Deno](https://deno.land/) server to run [Jitar](https://jitar.dev) applications.

We've created this implementation for several reasons. We want to support deno in the future and it helps us to get a better view on the shared components between the servers implementations. 

To run an application with deno, it needs to be written in JavaScript, which is directly one of the main drawbacks of the implementation at the moment.

If you are a deno specialist, let's know!
