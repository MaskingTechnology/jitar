# Jitar - Distributed runtime

<img width="1102" alt="explainer" src="https://github.com/MaskingTechnology/jitar/assets/108156553/2129b4cc-a32c-497e-b69d-d5670a66d7aa">

Welcome to [Jitar](https://jitar.dev), a runtime that automates all end-to-end communication for your JavaScript and TypeScript applications. You can call your server functions directly, Jitar takes care of the rest.

In contrast to any framework-like solution, there is no trace of Jitar in the application code. Jitar breaks up your application as configured on the go, so you can build your application as a monolith and deploy it as microservices.

Free yourself from the burden of building and maintaining APIs. Jitar is the missing link between frontend and backend.

# How it works

Building scalable applications is hard. It requires breaking an application into independently deployable pieces, like microservices. The boundaries of these pieces are sensitive to change and aren't always clear. Developing endpoints and requests to arrange the communication between them brings a lot of overhead.

Jitar is designed to solve these problems. It makes the boundaries configurable so you can change them painlessly at any time and eliminates the overhead by automating the end-to-end communication.

For breaking applications into distributable pieces, Jitar uses a segmentation system. A segment defines what functions need to be deployed together. Jitar connects these segments by creating RPC endpoints and requests under the hood.

# Key benefits

Developers are at the heart of every application. Jitar is designed to make their lives easier and more productive.

* **API automation** - Automates all client-server communication.
* **E2E type-safety** - Reduces programming and refactoring errors.
* **Configuration only** - Keeping the code clean, simple and focussed.
* **E2E Intellisense** - Speeds up developing full-stack apps.
* **Platform agnostic** - Runs in modern web browsers, servers and on the server.
* **Framework agnostic** - Works with every frontend and backend framework.

# Key features

Build a monolith, deploy as microservices. Jitar provides powerful features to scale endlessly.

* **Segmentation** - Breaks down applications into deployable packages.
* **Orchestration** - Coordinates running segmented procedures.
* **Load balancing** - Balances the execution of procedures automatically.
* **Access protection** - Protects the access to private procedures.
* **Transportation** - (De)serializes data automatically.
* **Multi-version** - Supports multiple versions of the same procedure.
* **Integration** - Integrates in any existing landscape.
* **And more** - Validation, health checks, middleware, hooks, etc.

# When to use

Jitar is a great tool for building applications that are expected to grow and change over time. It can be used for building small to large API driven (web) applications, like:

* Full-stack applications
* Microservices

For existing applications, Jitar can be of great assistance for load balancing (parts) of the application, or adding multi-version support.

# Getting started

Getting started with Jitar is as easy as pie. It only takes a few simple steps.

1. **Create new project** - Start fast with our creator and pick one of our templates for Vue, React, SolidJS and more.
1. **Add your functions** - Write functions and export them like you are used to.
1. **Configure what runs on the server** - Add the exported functions to a server segment configuration file.
1. **Run your application** - Jitar will take care of the rest.
