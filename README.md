# Jitar - Distributed runtime

Welcome to [Jitar](https://jitar.dev), a full-stack JavaScript runtime for small to large web applications. It lets you to build monolithic applications and run them spread out over multiple servers and web browsers. Jitar takes care of the inner communication, so you don't have to build any API.

Jitar runs on top of Node.js and in any modern web browser. It has strong support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Because it's only a runtime, you can use the frameworks you already love at the front- and back-end.

More information can be found on our [website](https://jitar.dev).

## Background information

Jitar is an abbreviation of **just-in-time architecture**, a flexible architurecture style that is a part of Masking Technology's vision on building future-proof applications. Its intend is to close the gap between front- and back-end and provide a more cost efficient and flexible alternative to the microservice and serverless architecture (function as a service) types. With Jitar, applications can start as a monolith and broken down into smaller distributable pieces. It reduces the need for up-front architectural design and simplifies orchestration and deployment.
